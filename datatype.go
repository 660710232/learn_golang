	// Interger is  a number like 1,2,3,4,5, etc. it can be positive or negative
	// unsigned integer is a only positive integer and signed integer is a positive and negative
	// int use 32 bit and 64 bit (system)
	// int have int8, int16, int32, int64 
	// like uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64

	// float is a number with decimal point like 3.14, 2.718, etc.
	// float have float32 and float64

	// string is a sequence of characters
